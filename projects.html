              This project is a Plant Swap service where private individuals can
              swap or buy plants from one another.

              The application is coded in <strong>Java</strong> and is a
              <strong>Spring boot REST API</strong> with
              <strong>Maven</strong> using a
              <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> database and run via a
              <strong>Docker</strong> container. The application is backend-only
              and is best experienced using the
              <strong>Postman</strong> documentation linked in the article.

          <section class="main-section-content-body project-body">

              The application has three main model classes: (1) User, (2) Plant
              and (3) Transaction which all have CRUD implementation and for
              which data are stored in three separate PostgreSQL database
              tables. Each model class has a related service, repository and
              controller class. The database has a
              <strong> normalization of 3N </strong>, with very low data
              redundancy and the application has very
              <strong> robust validation and error handling </strong>

              The Plant Swap service allows for registration, update, deletion
              of users (User class), plant listings (Plant class) and
              purchase/swap requests (Transaction class). A plant listing must
              either be for swap (and then have swap condition listed) or for
              purchase (and then have a price). Transactions for plants that are
              for purchase are accepted automatically, while transactions that
              are swap offers must be accepted or rejected manually via API
              end-points.
            </p>
            <p>
              The project has a very
              <strong> robust validation </strong> implementation which checks
              that all user input (RequestBodies and RequestParameters) is valid
              and otherwise cast appropriate error messages. Use of
              <strong> global error handling </strong> ensures that errors
              caught and handled in uniform manner.
            </p>
            <p>
              The User entity has a <strong> one-to-many </strong> relationship
              to both the Plant entity (plant listing) and the Transaction
              entity. Furthermore, the Plant has a one-to-many relationship with
              Transaction, since a transaction request can be rejected, and it
              should then be possible for another transaction to be made for
              that same plant listing.
            </p>

            <p>
              In general, the project has
              <strong> delete on cascade </strong> for the database. However,
              there are many method-checks for if a delete request is allowed.
              For example, if a plant listing has a pending transaction request,
              deletion of that plant is not allowed and attempts to delete it
              will cast an error message informing the user that pending
              transactions must be resolved before it can be deleted.

              This application is modelled after AirBnB, and allows users to
              publish and manage listings, make bookings and leave reviews. The
              application has four main model classes (User, Listing, Booking,
              Review) and uses <strong> DTOs </strong> to package and deliver
              information between the controller classes and the service classes
              (where the DTOs are mapped to and from the different model
              classes). A user can own several listings, bookings and reviews,
              and therefor has a <strong> one-to-many </strong> relationship to
              all of these. Similarly, a listing can have many bookings and
              reviews and therefor has a
              <strong> one-to-many </strong> relationship to these.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since the database used is a NoSQL database, the data is not
              normalized and things such as username and listing title are
              sometimes double stored in bookings or reviews, to allow for e.g.,
              showing the username of the person leaving the review without
              retrieving data from any source other than the review entity
              itself. During development we used a
              <strong> MongoDB Atlas cluster </strong> in order for the whole
              team to work with the same database.
            </p>

            <p>
              The application has a comprehensive Spring Security
              implementation, which uses e.g., <strong>filter chains</strong>,
              <strong>JWT tokens</strong>,
              <strong>CORS configuration</strong> and
              <strong>password authentication</strong>. The application has
              end-point access regulation based on if the current user is logged
              in and (if they are) what roles they have.
              <strong> Non-logged in user </strong>has the
              <strong> lowest access level </strong>, and can only browse the
              listing in the database (along with associated reviews and host
              profile), as well as register a new user or log in. A logged in
              user with the <strong> role admin </strong> has the.
              <strong> highest access level </strong> and can manage their own
              profile, listings, bookings and reviews, as well as delete those
              of other users.
            </p>

            <p>
              The project has a very
              <strong> robust validation </strong> implementation which checks
              that all user input (RequestBodies and RequestParameters) is
              valid. This is done both through the
              <strong> @Valid annotation </strong> and through checks in the
              service class methods. Use of
              <strong> global error handling </strong> ensures that errors
              caught and handled in uniform manner.

              This website is a front-end only application coded in html, CSS

              layout according to the view port screen, using
              <strong>media queries</strong> for
              <strong>three different minimum view port widths</strong>. It also

              Narrow down the window width and see the design change at
              <strong> 900px, 575px and 400px</strong> break points. The break
              points are set according where they need to be in order for the
              layout to always remain pleasing and functional.
            </p>
            <p>
              At 575px the secondary navigation menu (circular icon buttons)
              moves to the top and the main menu (and secondary menu)
              <strong>becomes fixed</strong> at its top positions even when
              scrolling. At 400px the main menu splits the four options into two
              rows.
            </p>
            <p>
              The secondary menu consists of circular buttons with white icons,
              when hovering over a button, it expand to show a the title of the
              menu option. When the button is clicked the button is fixated in
              its exanded layout form using JavaScript functions. The hover
              effects are done using both CSS and JavaScript in combination.
            </p>
            <p>
              The contact form on the Contact page is sadly not functional as a
              contact form (i.e., the message is not sent anywhere - as of
              yet!), but it does have <strong>form validation</strong> through
              JavaScript, which checks that the user has filled out all fields
              before clicking submit.
