            <p>Welcome to my very own personal website.</p>
            <p>
              I am a full stack developer student, and this website is one of
              the coding projects through which I am learning and growings as
              developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              With this website - both as a project and as a source of
              information about me - I aim to show you my passion for coding,
              love for software development and determination to never stop
              learning and growing.
            </p>

            <p>
              Currently studying to become a full stack developer. My main
              programming language is Java, but I also have some experience
              working with Python and am currently learning JavaScript (incl.
              the React JS framework). I am very eager to expand my knowledge
              and tools set and would be more than happy to learn e.g. C/C++/C#.
              Quick learner with previous work life experience in the Life
              Science field.
